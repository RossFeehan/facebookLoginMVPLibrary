# facebookLoginMVPLibrary
A library for loging a user into an app using facebook login. This app is missing the Facebok App ID in R.string, this will have to be added in order to see the app run fully. 

Also this logs the user in through facebook and receives a token back from facebook, in order to keep the user logged into your app this facebook token will have to be sent to your backend in order to save it and create a user profile on this system. The data layer for creating a new profile on your system will also have to be implemented.
